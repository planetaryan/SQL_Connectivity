The Automobile Assembly Database Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the assembly process within automobile manufacturing 
facilities. It facilitates efficient management of employees, assembly lines, vehicles, machinery, 
and inventory, offering a centralized platform for monitoring and coordinating various aspects of 
the assembly operations. 
 
Key features of our Database Management System include employee management 
functionalities, enabling administrators to assign roles. Assembly lines are efficiently organized 
and monitored within the system, allowing for seamless allocation of vehicles to specific lines 
and tracking the progress of assembly tasks. It also provides detailed insights into machinery 
utilization by associating specific machines with assembly lines and employees. This allows for 
effective scheduling and maintenance of machinery to ensure uninterrupted production flow 
 
Furthermore, it offers comprehensive expense tracking capabilities, providing insights into the 
total expenses incurred throughout the assembly process. This includes expenses related to labor, 
machinery maintenance, and inventory procurement, enabling management to enhance cost 
efficiency.
